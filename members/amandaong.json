  "about": "I enjoy working on products with a real-world application, which why I really like DTI! Outside of classes, I’m also the tech lead for the Engineering Career Fair Team. I enjoy being active when I can. When I’m home, I like to bike around the neighborhood and I’m hoping to learn how to snowboard or ice-skate this year. I also enjoy a variety of music, but my favorites are Troye Sivan, Noah Kahan, and Shawn Mendes.",
